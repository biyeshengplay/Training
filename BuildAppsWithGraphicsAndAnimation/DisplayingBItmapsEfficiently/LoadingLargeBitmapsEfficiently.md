## 高效加载大图
Images come in all shapes and sizes. In many cases they are larger than required for a typical 
application user interface (UI). For example, the system Gallery application displays photos taken 
using your Android devices's camera which are typically much higher resolution than the screen 
density of your device.

Given that you are working with limited memory, ideally you only want to load a lower resolution 
version in memory. The lower resolution version should match the size of the UI component that 
displays it. An image with a higher resolution does not provide any visible benefit, but still 
takes up precious memory and incurs additional performance overhead due to additional on the fly 
scaling.

This lesson walks you through decoding large bitmaps without exceeding the per application memory 
limit by loading a smaller subsampled version in memory.

## Read Bitmap Dimensions and Type
The BitmapFactory class provides several decoding methods (decodeByteArray(), decodeFile(), 
decodeResource(), etc.) for creating a Bitmap from various sources. Choose the most appropriate 
decode method based on your image data source. These methods attempt to allocate memory for the 
constructed bitmap and therefore can easily result in an OutOfMemory exception. Each type of decode 
method has additional signatures that let you specify decoding options via the BitmapFactory.Options
 class. Setting the inJustDecodeBounds property to true while decoding avoids memory allocation,
  returning null for the bitmap object but setting outWidth, outHeight and outMimeType. This 
  technique allows you to read the dimensions and type of the image data prior to construction 
  (and memory allocation) of the bitmap.

BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
options.inJustDecodeBounds = true;
BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(), R.id.myimage, options);
int imageHeight = options.outHeight;
int imageWidth = options.outWidth;
String imageType = options.outMimeType;
To avoid java.lang.OutOfMemory exceptions, check the dimensions of a bitmap before decoding it,
 unless you absolutely trust the source to provide you with predictably sized image data that
  comfortably fits within the available memory.

## Load a Scaled Down Version into Memory
Now that the image dimensions are known, they can be used to decide if the full image should be 
loaded into memory or if a subsampled version should be loaded instead. Here are some factors to 
consider:

Estimated memory usage of loading the full image in memory.
Amount of memory you are willing to commit to loading this image given any other memory requirements
 of your application.
Dimensions of the target ImageView or UI component that the image is to be loaded into.
Screen size and density of the current device.
For example, it’s not worth loading a 1024x768 pixel image into memory if it will eventually be 
displayed in a 128x96 pixel thumbnail in an ImageView.

To tell the decoder to subsample the image, loading a smaller version into memory, set inSampleSize 
to true in your BitmapFactory.Options object. For example, an image with resolution 2048x1536 that 
is decoded with an inSampleSize of 4 produces a bitmap of approximately 512x384. Loading this into
 memory uses 0.75MB rather than 12MB for the full image (assuming a bitmap configuration of ARGB_8888). 
 Here’s a method to calculate a sample size value that is a power of two based on a target width and 
 height:

public static int calculateInSampleSize(
            BitmapFactory.Options options, int reqWidth, int reqHeight) {
    // Raw height and width of image
    final int height = options.outHeight;
    final int width = options.outWidth;
    int inSampleSize = 1;

    if (height > reqHeight || width > reqWidth) {

        final int halfHeight = height / 2;
        final int halfWidth = width / 2;

        // Calculate the largest inSampleSize value that is a power of 2 and keeps both
        // height and width larger than the requested height and width.
        while ((halfHeight / inSampleSize) > reqHeight
                && (halfWidth / inSampleSize) > reqWidth) {
            inSampleSize *= 2;
        }
    }

    return inSampleSize;
}
Note: A power of two value is calculated because the decoder uses a final value by rounding down 
to the nearest power of two, as per the inSampleSize documentation.

To use this method, first decode with inJustDecodeBounds set to true, pass the options through 
and then decode again using the new inSampleSize value and inJustDecodeBounds set to false:

 public static Bitmap decodeSampledBitmapFromResource(Resources res, int resId,
        int reqWidth, int reqHeight) {

    // First decode with inJustDecodeBounds=true to check dimensions
    final BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
    options.inJustDecodeBounds = true;
    BitmapFactory.decodeResource(res, resId, options);

    // Calculate inSampleSize
    options.inSampleSize = calculateInSampleSize(options, reqWidth, reqHeight);

    // Decode bitmap with inSampleSize set
    options.inJustDecodeBounds = false;
    return BitmapFactory.decodeResource(res, resId, options);
}
This method makes it easy to load a bitmap of arbitrarily large size into an ImageView that 
displays a 100x100 pixel thumbnail, as shown in the following example code:

mImageView.setImageBitmap(
    decodeSampledBitmapFromResource(getResources(), R.id.myimage, 100, 100));
You can follow a similar process to decode bitmaps from other sources, by substituting the 
appropriate BitmapFactory.decode* method as needed.
